### Logging
Logging is turned off by default. Modify the root level in the `src/main/resources/logback.xml` file to turn it on (e.g. `INFO`).

### Docker
The `docker/` directory contains files required to build the Docker image.
All files in the `scripts/` sub-directory are copied to the image, into a sub-directory that is on the `$PATH`, 
and made executable.

The `gradle.properties` file specifies the path to the default Docker image used by the CLI.

#### Build a new image
For any change in this directory to take effect:
1. Build a new image.
    ```
    > ./gradlew buildDockerImage
    [...Docker build output...]
    terra-cli/local:b5fdce0 successfully built
    
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 25s
    1 actionable task: 1 executed
    ```
2. Update the image id that the CLI uses. (See output of previous command for image name and tag.)
    ```
    > terra app set-image terra-cli/local:b5fdce0
    ```

#### Pull an existing image
The `tools/local-dev.sh` script pulls the default image already.

To use a specific Docker image from GCR:
1. Pull the image with that tag.
    ```
    > ./gradlew pullDockerImage -PdockerImageTag=b5fdce0
    Task :pullDockerImage
    b5fdce0: Pulling from terra-cli-dev/terra-cli/v0.0

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s
    1 actionable task: 1 executed
    ```
2. Update the image id that the CLI uses. (See output of previous command for image name and tag.)
    ```
    > terra app set-image gcr.io/terra-cli-dev/terra-cli/v0.0:b5fdce0
    ```

#### Publish a new image
To publish a new image to GCR:
1. Build the image (see above).
2. Push it to GCR.
    ```
    > ./gradlew publishDockerImage -PdockerLocalImageTag=b5fdce0
      
    Task :publishDockerImage
    Reading the CI service account key file from Vault

      BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 26s
      1 actionable task: 1 executed
    ```
3. Update the image id that the CLI uses. (See output of previous command for image name and tag.)
    ```
    > terra app set-image gcr.io/terra-cli-dev/terra-cli/v0.0:b5fdce0
    ```

#### Update the default image
To update the default image:
1. Build the image (see above).
2. Tag the image locally with `stable`. (See output of build command for local image name and tag.)
    ```
    docker tag terra-cli/local:b5fdce0 terra-cli/local:stable
    ```
3. Bump the version number in the image name in `gradle.properties`.
    ```
    dockerImageName=terra-cli/v0.1
    ```
4. Publish the new (`stable`-tagged) image to GCR (see above).
5. Update the `DockerAppsRunner.DEFAULT_DOCKER_IMAGE_ID` property in the Java code.


### Code structure
Below is an outline of the directory structure. Details about each are included in the sub-sections below.
```
src/main/
  java/
    bio/terra/cli/
      apps/
        interfaces/
      auth/
      command/
      context/
      service/
  resources/
      servers/
```

#### Servers
The `src/main/java/resources/servers/` directory contains the server specification files.
Each file specifies a Terra environment, or set of connected Terra services, and maps to an instance of the 
`ServerSpecification` class.

The `ServerSpecification` class closely follows the Test Runner class of the same name.
There's no need to keep these classes exactly in sync, but that may be a good place to consult when expanding the 
class here.

To add a new server specification, create a new file in this directory and add the file name to the `all-servers.json` 
file.

#### Command structure
The `src/main/java/bio/terra/cli/command/` directory contains the hierarchy of the commands as they appear to the user.
With the exception of the `app/supported` sub-directory, the directory structure matches the command hierarchy.

`Main` is the top-level command and child commands are defined in class annotations.
Most of the top-level commands (e.g. `auth`, `server`, `workspace`) are strictly for grouping; the command itself 
doesn't do anything.
An empty class body with child commands defined in the annotation creates such a grouping command.

Supported tools are currently children of the top-level command, but are hidden from the usage help.

#### Context classes
The `src/main/java/bio/terra/cli/context/` directory contains the objects that represent the current state.
Since the CLI Java code exits after each command, this state is persisted on disk by the `GlobalContext` and 
`WorkspaceContext` classes.

Other packages (e.g. `src/main/java/bio/terra/cli/app/`, `auth/`, `server/` and `workspace/`) contain classes that 
manipulate the context objects. Classes are grouped into packages by general functional area.

#### Supported tools
The `src/main/java/bio/terra/cli/apps/` directory contains (external) tools that the CLI supports.
Currently these tools can be called from the top-level, so it looks the same as it would if you called it on your 
local terminal, only with a `terra` prefix. For example:
```
terra gsutil ls
terra bq version
terra nextflow run hello
```

The list of supported tools that can be called is specified in an enum in the `terra app list` class.

### Add a new supported tool
To add a new supported tool:
   1. Install the app in the `docker/Dockerfile`
   2. Build the new image (see instructions in section above).
   3. Set the image that the CLI will use 
   3. Test that the install worked by calling the app through the `terra app execute` command.
   (e.g. `terra app execute dsub --version`). This command just runs the Docker container and 
   executes the command, without requiring any new Java code. This `terra app execute` command
   is intended for debugging only; this won't be how users call the tool.
   4. Add a new command class in the `src/main/java/bio/terra/cli/command/app/passthrough` package.
   Copy/paste an existing class in that same package as a starting point. Gsutil, Bq, and Gcloud 
   are the simplest.
   5. Add it to the list of tools shown by `terra app list` by adding the new command class to
   the list of sub-commands in the `@Command` annotation of the `Main.class`. This means you can
   invoke the command by prefixing it with terra (e.g. `terra dsub -version`).
   6. When you run e.g. `terra dsub -version`, the CLI:
      - Launches a Docker container
      - Runs the `terra_init.sh` script in the `docker/scripts` directory, which activates the userâ€™s
      pet service account and sets the workspace project
      - Runs the dsub command
   7. You can pass environment variables through to the Docker container by populating a `Map` and
   passing it to the `DockerAppsRunner.runToolCommand` method. Two environment variables are always
   passed:
       - `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` = the workspace project id
       - `PET_KEY_FILE` = the pet service account key file
   8.  You can mount directories on the host machine to the Docker container by populating a second
   `Map` and passing it to the same `DockerAppsRunner.runToolCommand` method. The `nextflow` command
   has an example of this (see `bio.terra.cli.apps.Nextflow` class `run` method).
   9. Publish the new Docker image and update the default image that the CLI uses to the new version
   (see instructions above).
